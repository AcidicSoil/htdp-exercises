; Will sum and how-many work for NEList-of-temperatures even though
; they are designed for inputs from List-of-temperatures? If you think
; they donâ€™t work, provide counter-examples. If you think they would,
; explain why.

; Yes, they will work with any NEList-of-temperatures, because the set
; of NEList-of-temperatures is just a subset of List-of-temperatures
; that excludes the empty list. Since both functions are designed to
; work with any List-of-temperatures, they will work with any instance
; of its subset NEList-of-temperatures.
