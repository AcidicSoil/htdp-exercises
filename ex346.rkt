(define-struct add [left right])
; An Addition is a structure:
;   (make-add BSL-expr BSL-expr)
; interpretation (make-add a b) is the sum of a and b

(define-struct mul [left right])
; A Multiplication is a structure:
;   (make-mul BSL-expr BSL-expr)
; interpretation (make-mul a b) is the product of a and b

; A BSL-expr is one of the following:
; - Number
; - Addition
; - Multiplication

; A BSL-eval is a Number
; interpretation the result of evaluating a BSL-expr
