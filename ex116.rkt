; Explain why these sentences are syntactically legal expressions:

; x
; It's a variable, and every variable is an expression

; (= y z)
; It's a primitive application applied to two variables,
; therefore it's an expression

; (= (= y z) 0)
; It's a primitive application applied to an expression and a constant,
; therefore it's an expression
