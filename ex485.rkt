; Q: What is its abstract running time?
; A: 2^n
; Q: What is an acceptable measure of the size of such a tree?
; A: The maximum depth of the tree, i.e. the first tree has depth 0
; while the third tree has depth 3.
; Q: What is the worst possible shape of the tree?
; A: A tree of minimum depth equal to its maximum depth, i.e.
; a tree that consists of pairs until the last level.
; Q: Whatâ€™s the best possible shape?
; A: A tree consisting of a single number.
